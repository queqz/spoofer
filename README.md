# Queqz Spoofer folder
Here's my whole folder of spoofers that I use for unbanning for ANY game that I know.
## Usage
Open CDCleaner.exe and go through the process. Then open AppleCleaner.exe and do the same for it.
## Extra
I only tested it on Windows 10, but if you've tested it on Windows 11 and more versions, consider to write this in the issues tab, so that I can write it into here!
## Warning
Only use this for educational purposes! You may will contest problems like having to reset your bios or replug Motherboard cables, because it will change the Motherboard ID and name, so you probably won't be able to change the lights of your Motherboard. I also had to replug my RGB-Headers of my fans, but I don't know why unfortunately.
